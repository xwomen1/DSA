## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Go (Golang)
- **Tooling:** LeetHub (Automatic sync), VS Code
- **Focus:** Efficiency (Time & Space complexity optimization)

## 📂 Project Structure
The repository is organized by problem difficulty and topic:
- `/easy`: Foundational problems for warming up.
- `/medium`: Core algorithmic challenges (BFS, DFS, Dynamic Programming).
- `/hard`: Complex problems requiring advanced optimizations.
- `/structures`: Custom implementations of basic Data Structures in Go.

## 🏆 Key Solved Problems
| # | Title | Solution | Difficulty | Keywords |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Two Sum | [Go](./easy/two_sum.go) | Easy | `Hash Map` |
| 20 | Valid Parentheses | [Go](./easy/valid_parentheses.go) | Easy | `Stack` |
| 3 | Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | [Go](./medium/longest_substring.go) | Medium | `Sliding Window` |
| 200 | Number of Islands | [Go](./medium/num_islands.go) | Medium | `DFS/BFS` |

## 📈 Learning Roadmap
- [x] Arrays & Hashing
- [x] Two Pointers & Sliding Window
- [x] Stack & Queue
- [ ] Binary Search & Linked Lists (In Progress)
- [ ] Trees & Graphs
- [ ] Dynamic Programming

## ✍️ How to Use
Each solution file includes:
1. The problem link.
